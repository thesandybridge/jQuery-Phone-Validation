## jQuery Phone Validator

This validator supports 3 formats as of now. 
`(123) 456-7890`
`123.456.7890`
`123-456-7890`

This function will automatically replace the users input with the implied format.

Setup is simple, download the `scripts.js` file and place it in your js folder.
Change the `id` declaration to match the id of the input you wish to effect.

### Be sure to change the limit of the input fields to match the amount of characters you will be using.
